            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And in this is fulfilled all that which the Lorde foretold thereof in the 12. of the <hi>Apoc.</hi> &amp; as the miſeries foretold are fulfilled, in like maner the promiſed deliuerance ſhal be accompliſhed, and alwaies this goodly ſentence ſhall remaine true that is in the <hi>76.

            <p>As the ſecond preaching was ended, and the <hi>Pſalme</hi> aforenamed ſung, behold certaine ſtones throwen againſt the aſſemblie, and a Mutenie of people, which then did accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a proceſſion, that was made all for the nonce, who ruſhed vppon the aſſemblie, which was a godlie aſſemblie, with an extreme fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and had knocked downe all the troupe, if ſo be this good God had not raiſed vp ſome of the ſtrange ſouldiers, (which did ſhew themſelues more gentle than the Citizens, thirsting for the bloud of their fellow Citizens,) if they I ſay, had not couered a great part of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie, whereof notwithſtanding there were ſeuenſcore ſlaine and hurt.

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondlie, the doubts &amp; diſtruſts are contrarie vnto faith: if a man doe not reſolue himſelfe in GOD: if a man walke in vncertaintie:<note place="margin">Double errours in the Papal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in the maner of Faith.</note> if a man doe not aſſure himſelfe of his ſaluation as it is ſeene in the Papiſtes, howe they in this behalfe doe commit a double fault. In the firſt place, as it is to be ſeene in the ſixt ſeſſion of that goodlie councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> 9. Chapter. They taught how it was a vaine truſt, when as men did fullie
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:858:31"/> aſſure themſelues of Gods grace, and that none could knowe an aſſuredneſſe by faith, that he had the grace of God. O how bare, weake and vnable of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould our conſolation bee againſt ſinne, the diuell and hell, namelie in the article of death, if this doctrine tooke place! For that which they ſay, howe man becauſe of his infirmitie, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo aſſure him in his God: The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is eaſie, to wit, that the certaintie of faith, is of God and of his word, and not of our ſtrength and merites or deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings: and therefore it ouercommeth all our weakeneſſe. For we be alſo ſaued not after the greatneſſe and weakeneſſe of our beliefe: but through the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and mightineſſe of him, in whom we doe beleeue, that is to wit, Ieſus Chriſt: in ſuch ſort as weake faith leaueth not off to be a faith to ſaluation, becauſe it apprehendeth the euerlaſting ſonne of God. The other errour of the Papiſts is, that not fullie truſting in the Lord, they cal vpon Saints of both kindes, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, how that we do beleeue in one onelie God, and we muſt alſo call vpon God alone: For we doe call vpon him, in whom we doe beleeue and fully put
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:858:32" rendition="simple:additions"/> our aſſurance, <hi>Rom. 10.</hi> as alſo in the <hi>44. Pſalme:</hi> The Church proteſteth not to haue lifted vp hir handes to a ſtrange God. To be ſhort, there is nothing more contrarie vnto faith, than the diſtruſt of the goodneſſe, fauour, and aſsiſtance of our God, or to think y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath not heard our praiers: ſeeing that it is his proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to heare them, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith in the <hi>65. Pſalme, All creatures ſhall come vnto thee, becauſe thou heareſt their prayers.</hi> They ſinne there alſo againſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of faith, which do not beleeue that which they doe ſee, and ſo ſoone as they ſee no ſuccour, proſperitie, and riches, they are diſcouraged and leaue religion. And as it is ſaid in the eleuenth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrues,</hi> &amp; there prooued by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie goodlie examples; that faith is the reſt or ſtay of the thing a man hopeth for, &amp; a ſhew of things a man ſeeth not.</p>

                     <p>Thirdlie, this of all other is contrarie vnto faith, to purpoſe or to ſet foorth, or to eſtabliſh anie other thing than Chriſt

For there be many particularities that muſt bee noted vppon this deede. Chriſt was te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted a litle after Baptiſme. Euen ſo often ſhall thoſe bee aſſaulted with many &amp; diuers temptations, which ſhall receiue the guiftes of God, or that ſhalbe receiued into the Church. Firſt, becauſe that the graces which God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs are to ſtrengthen vs: then after, temptations are giuen vnto vs, to holde ourſelues in modeſtie, that wee ſhould not lift vp our ſelues aboue the guiftes of the Lorde:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</note> Thirdly to make knowen, how we haue truely forſaken Sathan, &amp; that we be made ſtrong through his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ſtrength.</p>

                     <p>True it is, that wee ought not to put vpon our ſelues temptations: So was our Lorde lead by the ſpirite into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: Therefore when God bringeth vs thither, then is it that wee ſhould lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade our faith.

Euen ſo Eue was tempted. For although it was through pride and preſumption, yet was the occaſion ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the ſight of a delectable fruit.</p>
                     <p>Therefore this is a warning to vs, to haue for ſuſpect the counſels of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and ſo not to be ſubiect to the foode or diet, becauſe that God will deſtroie both the meat and the bellie.

                     <p>But let vs remember, that the worlde is as a ſmoke, and all the goods of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:858:48" rendition="simple:additions"/> earth, as a ſhadowe: and that onely God is our all, and mans true wealth. Then let vs not hunger after earthly goods, neither worldly honors: but let vs hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe: for ſo are we exhorted in the 5. of S. <hi>Matthew:</hi> for it is that which is moſt neceſſarie for vs poore ſinners.

Let vs acknowledge that our life, our foode, and that of our children, dependeth not of the worlde, but of the grace and fauour of God: and to withſtand the diuell and all his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,<note place="margin">The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Chriſtians.</note> let vs daily arme vs, with this true bucklar of Gods woorde, as Ieſus Chriſt did: neither let vs goe into fight without armour.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:858:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> But if it be a queſtion of ſorrowes and tormentes, then death is no more it that we feare:<note place="margin">

                     <p>As concerning the bodie, that is put in the graue, we doe not thinke it loſt, becauſe that nothing is loſt but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and corruption, the which wee doe deſire to looſe.

For we muſt know God, as he reuealeth himſelfe otherwiſe we ſhould but woorſhip a fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie, in place of knowing and woorſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the true God. Now the true God, in whome we doe onelie beleeue,<note place="margin">

And yet
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:858:57" rendition="simple:additions"/> all this, by his word, which word is not a ſound in the aire, or a thing hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: but was from the beginning with God, and was God, of whome is ſpoken in the 33. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and alſo in the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>S.

For the ſpirit cannot ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie in this place the aire, or the winde, that was not yet created but is taken for a perſon ſubſiſtent. Afterwardes in the 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>S. Marke,</hi> we doe ſee the ſonne, which was baptiſed, the father bearing witneſſe of the ſonne: and the holy ghoſt comming downe vppon him. As it is alſo commaunded in the 28. of <hi>S. Matthew</hi> to baptiſe in the name of the father, the ſonne, and the holy ghoſt. Now thinke it not to be a ſmall thing, to acknowledge three perſons in one diuine Eſſence. Firſt of all, the Chriſtians faith is ſo diſcerned from that of the Turkes, Iewes, and Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims, which doe not woorſhip the true God, not acknowledging him as he hath manifeſted himſelfe. Secondlie, this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge guideth vs in our prayer and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs as a great direction, becauſe that we call vppon GOD, by Ieſus Chriſt, in the partaking of the holy Ghoſt. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:858:58" rendition="simple:additions"/> by this diſtinction of perſons, wee doe euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie ſee the principall benefites of our God, beholding how the father, the ſonne, and the holy ghoſt, haue wrought in our creation, and alſo how they doe worke in our redemption.

Wherefore although that all people doe vaunt of the knowledge of God, yet ſo it is that there is not but the true Church, that knoweth God truelie euen as hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted himſelfe.

                     <p>WHo hath meaſured the waters in his fiſt, and counted heauen with a ſpanne, and comprehended the duſt of the earth in a meaſure, and weighed the mountaines in a weight, and the hilles in a ballance?

                  <p>Yet followeth there an other more wonderfull witneſſe, and that preſenteth together vnto vs a paſſing goodneſſe and infinite power, that is to ſay the worke of our redemption. For to redeeme, and to quicken the creature that was loſt, and to buie him of ſuch a price, to wit, with the pretious bloud of Gods euerlaſting ſonne, and not to deliuer him onelie from bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and death, but alſo to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him euerlaſting life, this is ſo great a woorke, and ſo ſingular a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite, as no tongue can expreſſe, nor heart can ſufficientlie comprehend it. Hence it is that God hath ſo loued the world, that hee hath giuen his onelie ſonne, to the end that all thoſe which beleeue in him, ſhall not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life. Man was therefore created, good &amp; perfect as it is ſaid in the 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes:</hi> But he taried not in this happie eſtate: But following his owne inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and diſcourſes, with the euill counſell of the Diuell, hee was ſo tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from his GOD and by this meanes caſt headlong into deſtruction, as hee made himſelfe and his poſteritie guiltie of

O What a change and pitious alteration was this: when as the Image of God was ſo defaced in man, and that of ſo noble a creature, hee was become vile, miſerable, and full of ſinne and filth? For albeit, that man was faſhioned of the duſt of the earth, yet ſo was it that the ſpirit of God, if hee had not ſinned, had ſwallowed vp that which was of the earth, corruptible, and had freed man of his weakeneſſe and putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

                  <p>WIthout Ieſus Chriſt wee can finde no grace: and if we doe thinke to drawe anie thing without him, thoſe are as it were dead Cyſternes: But behold a good ſpring, &amp; a flowing fountaine, to wit, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hath, he hath it not by loue or by participation, as other creatures haue: but he hath it as the ſpring and fulneſſe of all good thinges. O what comfort is it, in that this fulneſſe is not

O Lord, thou haſt doone true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie more: For thou haſt not giuen an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, or an Archangell, but thou haſt

Sith now that he is ſo humbled and brought low to come vnto thee, wouldeſt thou diſpute much thereuppon? Rather acknowledge in all humbleneſſe, this bleſſing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſonne
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:858:100" rendition="simple:additions"/> of God, yea and with as great affection as thou canſt or maiſt: who is according to the euerlaſting diuine nature ingendred by the Father, not made, nor created, as it is ſaid in <hi>Athanaſius Creede,</hi> both without Mother and without beginning: but is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the humane nature a like vnto vs, ſinne excepted, begotten of a woman, and the ſonne of <hi>Dauid:</hi> In ſuch manner as <hi>Sedulius</hi> ſaith in a Hymme, The creator of the world hath taken ſhape of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, to the end that hee might redeeme our fleſh through his fleſh, and that thoſe ſhould not periſh whom hee had created. Therefore, behold two natures, but knit together in ſuch ſort, as there is but one onelie Sauiour: euen as the ſoule and the bodie are gathered together in one onely man, in the meane time keeping their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties as it is knowne, that ſome proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are of the bodie, &amp; others of the ſoule: but let a man marke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; put a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betweene thoſe proprieties, yet dooth hee not therefore ſeparate the bodie from the ſoule. The ſcriptures then, and alſo the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Doctors, ſpeaking of Ieſus Chriſt, haue ſometimes reſpect vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proprietie of the natures: And then it is ſaid: that Chriſt knew not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hower of Iudgement,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:858:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> when hee was wrapped vp in ſwadling bandes, when hee did increaſe in all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: and had reſpect but vnto the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature.

And ſometimes the ſcripture dooth conſider theſe two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Chriſt knit together. When it is ſaid, that the Lord of glorie was crucified. Wherefore? Becauſe that Chriſt hath yet ſuffered in the fleſh. Yet ſo it is, that hee who hath ſuffered, was the Lord of glorie. For this fleſh is knit with the eternal word of the perſonall vnion. So it is ſaid, that God hath redeemed vs by his bloud:<note place="margin">

As wee doe ſay for the vnion of the bodie with the ſoule, when a man is dead, albeit that there is but the leaſt part dead, to witte, the bodie, the ſoule being as we know immortal.<note place="margin">From whence hereſies doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede.</note> This is to be noted: becauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part of hereſies doe come forth in that, whereas either a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundes the natures of Chriſt, or that one ſundereth the natures, and they leaue not this ground or this foundation that wee
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:858:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> haue in the ſcripture, to wit, that there is but one Chriſt. And that this Chriſt is as mediatour knit vnto two natures, and to acknowledge them, it is neceſſarie that the proprieties do remain. For how ſhould we knowe the humane nature, if it were inuiſible, and in all places as ſome dreame? What God ſhould Ieſus be, if he were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, euen as <hi>Arritus</hi> did blaſpheme? The humane nature therefore of Chriſt hath reciued great prerogatiues,<note place="margin">Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues of Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> as to be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified from the beginning by the holy Ghoſt, to be knit with the diuine nature, and to abide in the ſame: ſo as of this man, it is ſayde, that he is the ſonne of God: as in hauing all fulneſſe of grace, all treaſures of wiſedome in the eternall worde, which is declared and laide abroade in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> humane nature, and ſo farre forth as was needeful, and might bring to him. To be ſhort, we muſt holde that as the humane nature ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the ſonne of God, hath not weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the diuinitie: So hath not the diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſwallowed vp the deity, nor conſumed the humanitie, as the <hi>Schuencfeldians</hi> thought.

Behold not that which is from me, or from Satan: Looke O Lorde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the humanitie of thy ſonne, to take pitie on mine infirmities: Conſider the puniſhment of the redeemer, and forgiue him his ſinnes, whome hee hath bought againe. Wherefore was it, that hee who was ſo obedient, ſhould ſuffer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of diſobedience, vnleſſe it were to ſaue vs? This is he, who is the good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, who hath brought home the ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheepe, and hath preſented before thy face thoſe that were ſtraglers and runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, by meanes of their ſinnes. O good God, therefore looke vppon thy deere ſonne ſpread abroad vppon the croſſe, bow downe thy head to ſee thy poore creatures, for the loue of whome, thy welbeloued yeelded vp his ſpirit vpon the croſſe, and hath bowed downe his head.</p>
                  <p>Behold his wounded handes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the offences of our handes. See his innocent ſide, whereout ran bloud and water in the day of his paſſion.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:858:117"/> pearſed with nailes, which neuer walked but in thy lawes, and in thy obedience, and haue compaſſion vpon vs, which haue walked in the way of ſinners: O glorious paſſion, that haſt ſlaine our enimie Sathan, and haſt purchaſed for vs ſo great a friend euen the eternall God. O what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is made, through this bleſſed and happie Paſſion, when as euerlaſting life is offered vnto vs, in ſtead of eternall tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thy ſonne went downe to hell,<note place="margin">His deſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into hell.</note> and hath felt the horrour and wrath that wee had deſerued, to exalt vs into heauen. O death where is thy ſtrength? O hell where is thy dread and feare, ſyth Chriſt hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed vs from both? O good God grant me grace nowe, that as thy ſonne hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for my ſake, ſo manie tormentes and rebukes, that I alſo may patiently abide puniſhment for his name. And as hee was ſtripped out of his garmentes, to goe to the croſſe, ſo let me be vnclothed of theſe worldly cares, and vncouered of my fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections, yea and aboue all, of pride &amp; of preſumption, to be arayed with a true faith, and with pitifull and heartie affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towardes my neighbours.

For Ieſus Chriſt, as the ſonne of God, hath had trulie alwayes all power in heauen, and in earth. And now this Ieſus, who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken humane nature, this perſon that is true God, and true man, gouerneth all thinges and hath a glorie and empire aboue all creatures, whereof it doth not followe, as ſome railers thinke, that this his humane nature is in al places and euerie where. For although that the right hande of God, and his mightineſſe is infinite, yet is it not ſaid, that he is made the right hande of God, or that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bodie of Chriſt is become the right hande of God: but that hee is ſet at his right hande.</p>
                  <p>Nowe to ſit at the right hande of God, is not to ſpreade his bodie throughout all, but to gouerne all with the father. And likewiſe that which is ſpoken of the whole perſon, cannot be particularly and ſimplie vnderſtoode of his humane nature, which keepeth alwaies his properties. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the ſcripture by this ſitting at the right hande of God, doth not conclude, that the bodie of Chriſt is throughout all:

                  <p>Satan from the beginning of the world was a lyar, and through lyes hath a deſire to tempt mankinde. Behold how <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> our firſt parentes were ouertaken and caught, which were created vnto the Image of God: For hauing beguiled them through lies, hee was therein alſo a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, in that that of the immortall, they became mortall. Not long after, hee ſet <hi>Caine</hi> againſt his Brother <hi>Abel,</hi> and did thruſt forward the brother to imbrue his handes with the bloud of his brother. And this is the manner and guiſe of all Satans kingdome. Hee began through lying to ſeduce men: afterward hee ceaſeth not, to ſtirre vp perſecutions, againſt the true faithfull, which would not cleaue vnto his lies. In the meane while, hee bringeth his maintainers to diſpaire, as it is to be ſeene of <hi>Caine, Iudas,</hi> and others. Therefore it is for vs to beware of ſo cruell and craftie an enemie. Let vs alſo beware and take good heede of his falſe and dreaming do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which commeth forth out of his ſhoppe, the end whereof is vtter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

                  <p>Moreouer, let vs marke, that our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, that Ieſus Chriſt was giuen vnto vs, who appeared to ouerthrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the workes of the diuell. And in deede, hee was found the ſtronger, that did buind his enemie Satan, and draue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Prince of the world.

For if a man would ſay, yea: but Chriſt is in heauen. Behold, that which Ieſus ſaith: If anie man keepe my word, hee ſhall not periſh. The doctrine of the lawe accuſeth vs, and ſetteth downe before vs our condemnation: But the Goſpell is the word of life and power of GOD to ſaluation. O miſerable and wretched world, that forſaketh this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious word.</p>
                  <p>The auncient Fathers haue woondred at a hearbe called <hi>Panacea,</hi> which as ſome ſay healed all maner of diſeaſes. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manie times we doe ſee, that men e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme more of ſome little experience of Phiſicke, that they ſhall haue againſt anie ſicknes: Why then doe they not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:858:149"/> and praiſe aboue all, the doctrine of the Goſpell, which healeth vs againſt death? Is it becauſe that the world is ſo earthlie, and luſtfull, which is not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe guided, but by fleſhlie conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and neither truſteth in God nor in his promiſes? But wee muſt feare the iudgementes of God. For as they, which doe keepe this word ſhall not feare death: So contrariwiſe, they that keepe it not, ſhall ſee the firſt and the ſecond death. And howſoeuer it ſeeme vnto men, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they paſſe away with eies cloſed vp vnto death, yet neuertheleſſe, they doe ſee death, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bitterneſſe thereof, and the wrath of God, preſent themſelues before their eyes. Now concerning the children of GOD, they ſee them dailie dying, and themſelues alſo doe die: But becauſe their ſoules learne the word of GOD, they ſee not death. For hee teacheth them, euen as thoſe that doe goe into darke pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the light, who ſee not the darkneſſe which is ouercome by the light. So a faithfull man, which poſſeſſeth Gods grace, doeth not behold death in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and as Gods iudgement, but as a ſweete ſleepe, whereby wee doe paſſe
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:858:150" rendition="simple:additions"/> into heauenlie reſt: and how much the more wee beleeue, ſo much the more are wee aſſured and certaine againſt death.

O how ſtrong is therefore the faithfull man, who is a member of the Church which ſtaieth himſelfe vppon the word of God.</p>

                  <p>The whole ſcripture is geuen by the inſpiration of God, and is profitable to teach, to correct, and to inſtruct in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe: that the man of God may be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, being made perfect vnto all good workes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt vſe of the ſcripture is to teach
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:858:151" rendition="simple:additions"/> vs: for where is it, that a man ſhall finde in other bookes, the ſecretes that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth vs? It learneth vs on the earth a ſcience which ſhall remaine in heauen, as <hi>S. Ierome</hi> ſayth it teacheth vs to knowe Chriſt, and in him the life euerlaſting. The Angelles doe woonder at this ſame do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as it is ſayde in the <hi>1. Chap.</hi> of the 1. Epiſtle of <hi>S.

                  <head>A meditation vpon the holy ſupper, whereby we do grow in the Church, and doe ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then our faith, drawen for the moſt part out of S. Cyprian.</head>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:858:152"/>
                  <p>WHen as this good ſauiour went to take the cuppe and drinke ſo bitter of his death and paſſion, his pleaſure was to ordaine and offer vnto vs the ſweete &amp; wholeſome lyquor of his bloud, with the partaking of his body. He raiſed vp <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> going to death, and appointed the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to make our ſoules to liue.</p>
                  <p>Hee then that gaue life vnto others, could he not well defende himſelfe againſt death, could it haue beene any other than a willing obedience, whereby hee would ſo fulfill our redemption? O howe great was the prouidence of this good ſauiour, which hath giuen vnto vs the partaking of his body before his death, to ſhewe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs that by death, hee ſhould not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and that he would neuer leaue his Church. But how? What banquet is this heere, to eate the fleſh of the Lorde and to drinke his bloud? Truely, it is a woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing, as we doe ſee in the <hi>6. Chap.</hi> of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> that the <hi>Capernaits</hi> coulde not comprehende. But beholde the ſecret, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſpake of his fleſh: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he did not ſpeake fleſhlie: he ſpake to eate, but it was not for our teeth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for our bellies, concerning the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this ſacrament: his wordes are
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:858:152"/> ſpirite and life. So as theſe ſacred meates, be of none other taſt, nor of any other ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour vnto a carnall and ſenſuall man. But whereas humane ſenſe cannot pearce through, there can faith enter: and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking, which ſeemeth harde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs at the firſt ſight, we ſhall finde them fitly applyed, if wee doe vnderſtande the language of the ſcripture. Therefore the worde of God ſometimees calleth this ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament bread, and ſometimes bodie, and fleſh, that by the helpe of theſe knowen thinges and viſible, we may comprehende the thinges that are inuiſible and ſpirituall. For as the bread nouriſheth the bodie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo doth Chriſt nouriſh the ſoule. As the fleſh is a ſubſtance, ſo is it not by ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that our ſoules are nouriſhed, but the ſonne of GOD incarnate, is the cauſe of this ſo ſubſtantiall a foode of our ſoules, becauſe that he was crucified for vs. As the life is in the bloud, ſo Chriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by his bloud hath giuen vnto vs life, and is our life, our fleſhe, our bloud, and our life was of a wretched condition: but by Chriſt, all the partes of our life are reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But from whence commeth this newe commaundement to partake with the bloud of Chriſt? Was it not forbidden in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:858:153" rendition="simple:additions"/> the lawe, to eate the bloud of any beaſt, becauſe that the life was in the bloud? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde alſo, the vndefiled Lambe. The bloud of beaſtes did ſhewe vnto vs, that our life ought not to be brutiſh, or that we ſhould be giuen to crueltie. And the bloud of Chriſt which wee are commaunded to drinke, teacheth vs, howe our liues ought to be Chriſtian like and pure: that wee might ſay with <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the <hi>2. Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> It is not I that liue, but Chriſt liueth in me. Therefore this communion is not a conſubſtantiation with the Trinitie, for there is but the father, the ſonne and the holy Ghoſt which are conſubſtantiall. It is not a confuſion of perſons in Chriſt: but it is an vnion of the heade, with the members, it is an vnion of affections, and of willes, a partaking together of the euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting riches, and in the life of Chriſt. This is a warning to be ſhort, that we muſt not liue vnto our ſelues, but vnto God. And as they that haue eaten ſome excellent meate, that hath in it ſome good ſauour, doe feele there in a good nouriſhment and ſweeteneſſe of breath: euen ſo muſt it be that they which are ſedde with this ſacred meate, and wherein Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, that in all their wordes and deedes,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:858:153"/> a man may feele a good ſmell, and that may increaſe to edification: and that all that which they doe, may bee vnto the glorie of this great GOD. And ſo we doe ſee, that it is not the teeth which wee doe ſharpen comming vnto this holy ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, but that we do bring hither faith, to diſtinguiſh the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from the thing of the ſacrament: the earthly element, from that which is diuine and heauenly: and ſo to conſider in one onely Chriſt, the vnion of two natures diuine and humane.</p>
                  <p>For altogether like as in the perſon of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Note this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of S. Cyprian.</note> the humane nature was ſeene here belowe, and the diuinitie was not ſeene, yet did it not leaue to worke great thinges without the chaunging of one nature into another: ſo in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, we doe ſee bread and wine: but the bodie of Chriſt, we doe not ſee: yet doth it not leaue to worke in vs, nowe that he is aſcended into heauen. And as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the light which is on high, is intire in himſelfe, howe ſo euer it be ſpreade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade heare beneath: So is Chriſt intire there on high, and yet leaueth hee not to partake himſelfe fully to euery one of vs, without leſſening himſelfe, when as hee
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:858:154"/> giueth himſelfe vnto vs which be weake, without being incloſed in the bread, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he is notwithſtanding receiued by vs, without darkening his maieſtie, when hee entereth into our ſmall tabernacle, and when he will that our heartes bee as his temple. O right bleſſed are they that thus doe eate the fleſh of the Lorde, hauing a deſire to remaine with him, and to obey him. The bodie of Chriſt ſet foorth in his worde is our foode. The meane and way to eate him is faith that doth ſtay vpon his promiſes, and is ioyned vnto him. On earth, we do communicate with Chriſt by the helpe of his worde, and ſacramentes: but on hie in heauen we ſhal eate this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bread, without anie outwarde helpe, and ſhall drinke this holy drinke, feeling effectually his preſence &amp; the ioie of that glorious life. O happy time ſo much deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the which we ſhall eate with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels, at the table of the Lorde, in his kingdome: O we now very happie &amp; bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from hence forth, ſeeing we ſauour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the ſweeteneſſe of the life to come in Chriſt. O howe eaſily may we deſpiſe the rich mens tables, and their iounket and delicate meates, to partake the bloude of Chriſt in the Church of God. Yea, this
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:858:154" rendition="simple:additions"/> bloud, yea this is our victorie and glorie, this is it that we ought to take chearefully in the ſupper, and ſo to beare with Chriſt all afflictions in this life: although the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket of the croſſe ſeeme verie thinne and troubleſome, vnto the beaſtly &amp; ignorant worlde. But they which do poſſeſſe Chriſt care not to poſſeſſe the world: and they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue drunke of the Lordes cup, care not, they are at a point to powre out their bloud for the name of Chriſt: for their liues are moſt aſſured in their ſauiour. Reioyce thou the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flocke of the Lorde, ſeeing thou haſt ſo liberall a ſheepeheard, which feedeth thee with his bloud, that thou maieſt liue by his life. For they that liue not but of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted bloud of <hi>Adam,</hi> and of the carnall and ſenſuall life, are more wretched than the beaſtes. To this feaſt are not onely bidden the ſacrificers and prieſtes of Leui, but all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. But aboue all, let vs take heede that this gift of God be vnto vs a whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome gift, and that we partake not therein to our condemnation. Let vs therfore take on the wedding garment, and make cleane our veſſels, to receiue ſo excellent a gift. Let vs alſo beware of hauing therein any profanation, in ſteede of deuotion. Let vs keepe our ſelues from communicating in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:858:155" rendition="simple:additions"/> darkeneſſe, when we doe come neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this light. And as <hi>S. Ierome</hi> ſayeth writing vnto <hi>Theophilus,</hi> When we drawe neere to Chriſt, let vs not giue him a <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> kiſſe. Let vs knowe, that theſe are the poore in ſpirite, that ſhall finde comfort in that banquet. Theſe are not the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, nor the high in degree, neither the ouerweening and brableſome perſons. For if Chriſt declare that euerie oblation diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth GOD, without reconciliation, howe ſhould he make an offering vnto vs, of a thing ſo ſingular, if wee haue not peaceable heartes? And if we be not knit together with our brethren, howe would we that he ſhoulde knit himſelfe with vs?</p>

For wee doe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in this Article, that wee doe beleeue by the word of God, who doeth witnes it, that our ſinnes are freelie forgiuen vs for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake. Thus this Article,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our ſinnes.</note> firſt repreſenteth before our eyes our ſinnes: the which are ſuch, as there is no humane ſatisfaction, that can abſolue vs therein: But we muſt humble our ſelues, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe our head, throw our ſelues at the feete of Ieſus Chriſt, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith in the 32. <hi>Pſalme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I acknowledged my ſinne vnto thee, neither hid I mine iniquitie: I thought I will confeſſe againſt my ſelfe my wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto the Lord, and thou forgaueſt the puniſhment of my ſinne. Therefore ſhall euerie one that is godlie make his prayer vnto thee.</p>
               <p>And <hi>S.

               <p>Now inſomuch as it is againſt God that wee ſinne, as it is ſaid in the 51. <hi>Pſal.</hi> It is alſo vnto him, that wee doe confeſſe our ſinnes, wee muſt note, that wee doe not buy, neither doe we deſerue the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe of our ſinnes: but wee doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, that is to ſay, wee doe hold it of the pure grace of God. <hi>Simon</hi> the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian was reproued in the 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Actes,</hi> who thought that the gift of God might bee bought for monie.</p>
               <p>Let vs come then without ſiluer, and haue recourſe vnto the throne of grace, where wee ſhall finde forgiueneſſe, not of one ſinne, but of all. For there is nothing condemnable to the children of God: And as all ſinnes are deadlie vnto the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: euen ſo are all ſinnes venial vnto the faithfull for Ieſus Chriſtes ſake, who is the aduocate for all our ſinnes, as <hi>S.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:858:163" rendition="simple:additions"/> Chriſtians are truelie bound to praiſe thsi good God with all their heartes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt benefit is, that all our ſinnes are forgiuen vs, through his diuine cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie. That commeth to paſſe, becauſe that Chriſt charging vppon him our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, by the oblation of his verie pretious ſelfe, hath reconciled vs, and is our true mediator and ſacrificer.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond benefit is, that the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which remaine in vs, namelie ſince this reconciliation, be it of bodie or of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are healed: becauſe that our ſinnes are not imputed vnto vs: And that in our infirmities God ſheweth his ſtrength and power in ſuſtaining vs.</p>
                  <p>The third is, hee redeemeth vs dailie from manie miſchifes &amp; dangers of death. For this nature is ſo fraile, as wee ſhould fall euerie moment into the graue, if God did not hold vs vp.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, that hee doeth couer vs with his graces, and with his mercie hee doeth crowne vs, making vs there to feele it mightilie: And by the ſame, doeth bleſſe and exalt vs, in ſtead of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs.</p>
                  <p>The fifth is, that hee dooth ſatiſfie vs, and giueth vs that that is ſufficient, a thing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:858:163" rendition="simple:additions"/> that is ſpeciall vnto the children of God. For God is not a niggard in his giftes: But as concerning vs, the moſt part are neuer contented. So that contentation is one of the great blesſinges of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>The ſixt benefit is this, Renewing, and this commeth vnto vs by Chriſt, in whom wee bee made newe creatures, and in whom we ſhall receaue a new and laſting life.</p>
                  <p>O how then hath the ſoule which fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſuch benefites good cauſe to bleſſe &amp; praiſe the Lord.</p>

And though wee bee deliuered to death, for the name of Ieſus: yet doe wee know that his life ſhall bee manifeſted in our mortall fleſh, as it is ſaid in the 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the 2. to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> But the fearefull and vnbeleeuing, the abominable, and murtherers, and whoremongers, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, Idolaters and lyers, ſhall haue their part in the lake, which burneth with fire and brimſtone which is the ſecond death.<note place="margin">

                  <head>Comfortes againſt death taken out of manie auncient Doctors.</head>
                  <p>IT is not without great reaſon, that the great philoſopher <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that the life of a wiſe man ought to paſſe in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall meditation of death. For wee ſhall in deede auoid a number of offences, if we haue in remembrance our end, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of this life, which is ſo ſhort, as it is ſaid in the 7. of <hi>Eccleſiaſt:</hi> Nowe it is a ſtrange thing to conſider the blockiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men in this caſe, which by dailie experience well ſee that they muſt die. They ſee well, that our bodies bee not made of iron nor of ſteele, but of a weake and variable ſubſtance. And yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, they diſpoſe not themſelues vnto their end, neither make anie prouiſion for thoſe thinges which concerne the time to come. The beaſtes herein doe paſſe vs, as <hi>Ieremie</hi> ſheweth in the 8. of his propheſie. For by the skie, the Storke knoweth the ſeaſon of the yeare, and the Turtle, and the Crane doe marke what time is fitteſt for their comming, and all theſe byrdes doe well knowe, howe that it is not alwayes Summer, and that Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will come.</p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:858:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>But men marke not the iudgementes of God, but ſleepe in the world, as if they ſhould neuer remoue. It is a thing verie certaine, that wee muſt all die: ſeeing that wee be all ſinners, and that death is the reward of ſinne, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> writeth in the 6. to the <hi>Romans.</hi> True it is that the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſetteth downe vnto vs three kindes of death. The one is the ſundering of the ſoul from the bodie, with making nothing of the bodie, vntill the reſurrection. An other is, the death of ſinne, as it is often ſaid: that men which are nouriſhed in their ſinnes, are dead. And Ieſus Chriſt ſpeaking of thoſe which knew not God, ſaid, Let the dead burie the dead.</p>
                  <p>The third is called in the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> the ſecond death, ſometimes the eternall death, whereunto the wicked ſhall bee condemned in the laſt iudgement. Now albeit that the Painimes ſometimes ſeeme to haue ſpoken pretilie of death: Yet ſo it is that two thinges haue made them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine in this matter and vnprouided of ſound conſolation.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that they neuer well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode the cauſe of death, neither the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie thereof: The one whereof was by the fall of <hi>Adam:</hi> the other giuen by Ieſus
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:858:176"/> Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer, they neuer vnderſtoode the ſpring of true life that lyeth in God, and in the beholding of his face, where of the children of God ſhall after the reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be the beholders both in ſoule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. Although then that <hi>Adam</hi> before his ſinne, was created according to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of the duſt of the earth: yet in deed, ſo it is that if hee had not ſinned, the diuine vertue and Image of God had ſwallowed vp in him all corruption, and defended him againſt death: in ſuch ſort as without griefe, when it had pleaſed God, he ſhould paſſe into heauenlie life. But his wilfull tranſgreſſing made him with his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſeruile vnto death, ſo as hee had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for him and for his, a moſt bleſſed condition, if hee had not ſinned. And as concerning that the death of <hi>Adam</hi> did not follow for his ſinne all at one time: it was not but through the mercie of our good God whoſe will is to preſerue man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: in the meane time puniſhing ſinne, in that that <hi>Adam</hi> and all his raſe haue bin and are of one mortall condition, full of labor and miſerie. Wee doe alſo ſee the pitifull entrie that wee doe make into the world: caſting forth a thowſand gronings
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:858:177"/> and ſighes from our firſt ariuall into the world.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore euerie one will eaſilie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that death is a thing moſt fearefull that can happen vnto man: becauſe that it doeth repreſent vnto vs at one time the wrath of God, and a miſerable vndoing of our life, whereof naturallie wee are ſo deſirous. Behold wherefore wiſe men are manie times giuen to ſearch out co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts, wherewith to ſweeten for vs the ſoure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of death. But thoſe that haue not taſted of the word of GOD, haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſtay vppon, not finding anie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, but that wee muſt beare that which is ordained for vs by an irreuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable arreſt. Manie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heathens being indued with a knowledge ſomewhat higher than the reſt, and affirming the immortalitie of the ſoule, hold this for a reſolution, that in the other life, the ſtate of good men ſhall bee happie: ſeeing that here belowe they be ordinarilie ſubiect to manie miſeries.</p>
                  <p>And in deede wee muſt come to this point, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by the temporall and preſent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, one ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not iudge of mens happineſſe: as alſo contrariwiſe, they that moſt doe proſper in this world in earthlie things, die
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:858:177" rendition="simple:additions"/> oftentimes as brute beaſtes hauing a ſoule buried in earthlie things: albeit that there is a difference betwixt man and beaſt, becauſe euerlaſting death is reſerued for the wicked: and becauſe the end crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke. Though that in this world a man receaued great giftes of God, yet the continuance, and all the vertues doe declare and ſhew themſelues chieflie in the Agonies of death. Therefore euen as one wretched nature hath brought vs vnto one lyke condition of death, ſo doeth the grace of God make the difference, that the one, to wit, the vngodlie, die to their deſtruction: And the other, which bee the children of God, guided by his ſpirit, and by his word,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.</note> doe die for to liue more happilie, ſo that their death is preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before GOD. Then let vs ſay that which is ſaid in the 23. of <hi>Numbers:</hi> I pray God I may die the iuſt mens death: which are aſſured as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith in the 19. <hi>Chapter,</hi> that one day they ſhall ſee GOD in their fleſh. This was the cauſe that men were cuſtomed to burie the dead with a certaine ſpeciall care. For as men locke vp their apparell in a cheſt, meaning to weare them againe: euen ſo
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:858:178" rendition="simple:additions"/> are the dead bodies buried in full hope of a certaine riſing againe.</p>
                  <p>Truelie wee ought well to wiſh this time where as Chriſt ſaith in the 22. of <hi>S. Matthew,</hi> when wee ſhall bee like vnto Angels, in happineſſe and in pure conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and thoughtes. Then ſhall this be the true fulfilling of our redemption, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we ſhal be gathered together on high, where there is neither cold nor heate,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoca.</hi> 7.</note> hunger nor thirſt: but a laſting bleſſedneſſe. But to whome is death pleaſant, but to thoſe that doe labour? The poore day-laborer is glad that he hath done his dayes labour. So is death ſweete vnto the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and the remembrance thereof is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to thoſe that reſt themſelues in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thinges. The chiefe point is, let vs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor whileſt it is day, and let vs learne to know God ſo long as we be in this world, ſeeing that in the knowledge of him lyeth our ſaluation. Oh what a comfort dooth a faithfull ſoule <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>inde, in that that Ieſus hath ſpoken in the 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>S. Iohn:</hi> My Father, I will that where I am, thoſe may be there alſo which thou haſt giuen me? So then when as wee doe meditate of theſe thinges in good time, death will be ſweete vnto vs. And thereuppon it
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:858:178" rendition="simple:additions"/> commeth to paſſe, euen as to thoſe whoſe diſcourſes and thoughtes haue bin ſweete vnto them all day long, that likewiſe their dreames bee all the night verie pleaſant and quiet. But the troubleſome men and buſie trotters vp and downe, haue their dreames commonlie full of vnquietneſſe. Such like ſhall the death of thoſe bee that doe incomber themſelues with worldlie thinges. And as <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, What is this but death? This is the leauing of the earthlie bodie, and a heauie burden: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided alway that an other burden more daungerous, which is ſinne, doe not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge vs: or (as ſaith <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the third <hi>Chap.</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalontans</hi>) wee muſt then let our conuerſation from henceforth be in heauen, whence we doe await after our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who ſhal tranſforme our bodies and make them conformable vnto his glorious bodie. Oh wonderfull mercie of this great God, that preſenteth life vnto vs not deſerued: &amp; putteth death farre from vs that wee haue merited. Oh what light is this word of God, that giueth vs light in the graue, and in the middeſt of death maketh vs to ſee? Therefore now the children of God doe no whit feare death: But as <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> writeth in a letter
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:858:179" rendition="simple:additions"/> which he ſent vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Confeſſors &amp; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of Ieſus Chriſt: Hee that hath once o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome death in his perſon dailie beateth it downe in his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers. So as we haue Ieſus Chriſt not onlie a beholder of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, but an aſſiſtant &amp; wreſtler with vs.</p>
                  <p>And as this good Doctor writeth in a treatiſe which he made of the mortalitie, the onlie way for a man y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil not come to Ieſus Chriſt, is to feare death: And not to be willing to come to him, is as much to ſay, as not to bee willing to raigne with him. What trauailer is he, which drawing neere vnto his home, reioyceth not, hauing paſſed through manie dangerous waies? And who is he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wil not willinglie runne out of a houſe that is readie to fall downe about his eares? What pleaſure haue we in this world which approcheth dailie to his end, and wherein wee buy the pleaſures ſo derely which we receiue in this life? What other thing is it but a continuall battaile, and a ſharp medley, wherein we be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſometime with enuie, ſometime with one thing, ſometime with an other, beſides the alaromes which doe giue vs in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of diſeaſes? Why ſhal we not ſay then with S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> I deſire to be looſed, &amp; to
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:858:179" rendition="simple:additions"/> be with Chriſt. Wherfore we praie dailie, <hi>Let thy kingdome come,</hi> but only for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deſire y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue to ſee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> accompliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thereof in an other life. For as S. <hi>Ierom</hi> doth large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie declare in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> funeral Sermon of <hi>Nepotian</hi> vnto <hi>Heliodor,</hi> if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                     <hi>Theſ.</hi> doeth not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether forbid mourning: yet is it for vs to behaue our ſelues more vertuouſlie than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Painims, &amp; not to ſhewe ſo great a mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for men, as it were a diſparing in vs of Gods mercies. And as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, VVherfore do we put on our black mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning weedes, when as our brethren goe to doe on their white garments to reſt with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lorde? Let vs ſorow for them rather as abſent, than dead: &amp; not as people that we haue loſt, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we a wait for to ſee againe. Alas y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is to be wailed for, it is that which men doe ſee in this worlde. VVe reade of <hi>Xerxes</hi> the great Lord and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, howe that hee had a deſire one day to viewe his whole armie, which was of a

Then that which wee ought to doe, is ſo to miſlyke of this life, which is but a vapour and a ſhadow of a true life, a traueling and a fraile life, that we ſuffer Chriſt to raigne and liue in vs, to the end that by him wee may haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, the which onelie deſerueth to bee eſteemed and called a life.</p>

I am vnworthie to bee called thy childe: but it hath pleaſed thee to bee my father. Thy will was that thy ſonne Ieſus ſhould come downe here below to vs, to make vs aſcend vp to thee. I feare not then death, ſeeing I haue life with me. Thy ſon hath deſtroyed death for all thoſe which doe beleeue in him: And albeit that this bodie be gnawen with wormes, yet the ſoul goeth forthwith into reſt, &amp; the body awaiteth the reſurrection.

Open vnto me then O Lorde the gate of thy kingdome. Make mee to heare this ſweete voice, which was prepared for the poore thiefe on the croſſe: To day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. Alas Lorde, I am vnworthy thereof: yet thy mercie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth me aſſurance.

               <p>THe doctrine contained in the Goſpell, is no other thing than the ordinance of our maiſter God, the grounde whereon to builde our hope and to ſtrengthen our faith, the foode wherewith to nouriſh our ſoule, the pylates whereby to guide our ſhippe in this nauigation, the helpes by whom we come to ſaluation, in ſuch ſort as when the faithfull heart yeeldeth it ſelfe to be trainable heere in earth, it is a meane to bring it vp vnto heauen. It hath pleaſed God that many thinges were often ſpoken by the prophetes and heard by them. But how much more excellent ought that to be reputed which the father hath ſayd and pronounced by his ſonne, than that which he hath ſayde by his ſeruantes? For in them ſpake the ſpirite of Chriſt, and he himſelfe hath ſpoken in the later time in his owne voice. He doth not now commaund, that men prepare the way vnto him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, becauſe that he himſelf is come, and diſcouereth the true way, that wee which goe wandering, and groping in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of death, may be by the light of his wiſedome directed in the way of life. Now amongeſt ſo many good leſſons as he hath left vs for our ſaluation,<note place="margin">The forme of praier.</note> hee hath chieflie giuen vnto vs the right forme of prayer,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:858:188" rendition="simple:additions"/> he that hath made vs to liue, hath taught vs alſo to pray, yea he hath done it after his grace &amp; goodneſſe wherethrough he hath ſtored vs with all thinges, and wrought it vnto the ende y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his father might the more willinger heare vs, when wee praie vnto him, in that praier that his ſon hath taught vs. He did foretell howe that the houre ſhould come, wherein the true woorſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers ſhould worſhippe him in ſpirite, and trueth. He hath alſo fulfilled that, which he had promiſed, giuing vs his ſpirite to worſhippe him.<note place="margin">The Lords praier.</note> What praier may be now more ſpirituall, than that which hath bin giuen vnto vs by Ieſus Chriſt, by whome alſo the holy ſpirite hath beene ſent vnto vs? What praier ſhalbe more true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect before God, than that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from the ſonne, who is the trueth of Gods owne mouth? In manner as otherwiſe to pray, concerning the ſubſtance then hee hath taught vs, is not alonely an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but alſo a blockiſh fault: as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh the Iewes elſewhere, how they did deſpiſe Gods commaundement, to ſet vp their traditions. Let vs therefore pray my brethren, euen as hee which is both our God and maiſter hath taught vs. That prayer is agreeable vnto God, when one
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:858:189" rendition="simple:additions"/> praieth with a praier that is his, and when we make the wordes of his ſonne to mount vp vnto his eares. The father doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his ſonnes language: when wee doe pray, let him that dwelleth in our heart be alſo in our voice &amp; vpon our tongue. And ſeeing that the ſonne is our aduocate, as often as we doe demaund forgiueneſſe for our ſinnes, let vs take in our mouthes the wordes of our aduocate. For ſeeing that he ſayth how all that we ſhall aske of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his name, it ſhalbe granted vnto vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal our praiers haue greateſt ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, but then when we ſhall call vppon him by the peculiar praier which he hath made? It behoueth thoſe which pray to keepe a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine forme in their ſpeach, with a ſtaied manner, and full of all reuerence &amp; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe. Let vs remember that it is before Gods face that we preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t our ſelues. Let vs therefore ſeeke to pleaſe him, as wel in the behauiour of our bodies, as in the conuei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our voice. It is an ill fauored thing and a ſigne of impudencie, to vſe much crying out in praier, and there is nothing that doeth ſet it out more than modeſtie. To be ſhort, wee doe ſee that the Lorde doth allowe that praier which is made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, in ſecret, and in ones chamber: a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:858:189" rendition="simple:additions"/> thing that well agreeth with our faith, to the ende to make vs vnderſtand that God is preſent throughout all, that he heareth and ſeeth all, and that the fulneſſe of his maieſtie pearceth into the moſt hidden &amp; ſecret places as the ſcripture ſpeaketh. I am thy God neere at hande, and not afarre off. If a man be hidden in a priuie or cloſe place, doe not I ſee him? Doe not I fill both heauen and earth? Then when wee ſhall come together with our brethren, we muſt in good order ſolemniſe the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of God, not thinking to make our praiers to take place before the Lord with chaunting and crying out.</p>
               <p>God vnderſtandeth the heart, not with the voice: for it is not needeful to aduertiſe him, by a lifting vp of a voice who ſeeth our thoughts. This is it that he often ſayth, that he is the ſearcher of hearts, hauing the knowledge of our moſt ſecret thoughtes.</p>
               <p>We haue a goodly example in the good woman <hi>Anna,</hi> mother of <hi>Samuel,</hi> who prayed vnto the Lord not with a ſtrong or lifted vp voice, but ſecretly, ſoberly, and in her heart. Her praier was ſecret, but her faith was open: ſhee ſpake not with the voice, but with the heart: knowing verie well that the Lorde our God ſo heareth his and in ſuch ſort, ſhe receiued in effect,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:858:190" rendition="simple:additions"/> that which by faith ſhe had required. We haue another example of a praier right wel directed and verie modeſt in the perſon of the Publicane. He went vp into the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and made his praier not in a rude and preſumptuous maner as the other, without lifting vp his head, or his forehead: he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fell downe, &amp; confeſſed with his mouth his ſinne, that hee felt ſhut vp in his heart: in ſuch ſort as God heard the prayer of the humble that reſted not vpon his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie. For who is hee that is innocent? His praier was humble, and hee which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunceth and fauoreth the humble, heard the poore Publican. Thus much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the faſhion and cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance that we ought to keepe in our praiers. Let vs now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how our maiſter hath taught vs to pray. When you pray, ſayth he, ſay thus:</p>
               <q>Our Father vvhich art in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, halowed bee thy name, thy kingdome come, thy vvill be done in earth as it is in heauen, giue vs this day our daily bread, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs our treſpaſſes as vve for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:858:190" rendition="simple:additions"/> them that trespaſſe againſt vs, &amp; leade vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euil. For thine is the kingdome, the povver and the glorie, for euer and euer. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</q>
               <p>THe firſt thing which wee learne in the entrie of this prayer,<note place="margin">An expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Lords prayer.</note> is that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of peace, and the Maiſter of all true vnion and concord, would not that our prayer ſhould be particular for one alone. See wherefore we doe not ſay, <hi>My father which art in heauen, giue me my dailie bread, &amp;c.</hi> Thus it appeareth, how this prayer is publike and common, and wee pray not for one alone but for all: becauſe in deede all Gods people is but one bodie. God would that one onelie making his prayer, ſhould pay for all the other, euen as one onelie man hath ſaued manie: and through one onelie ſpirit he gouerneth all his childrens heartes. And to this doeth agree that which wee doe read of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,<note place="margin">

<pb n="322" facs="tcp:858:191" rendition="simple:additions"/> companie. Now my brethren, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible thing how manie great ſecretes there bee here in this prayer of the Lorde, that is ſo well truſſed vp, and ſhort in wordes, but of moſt great ſtrength, and right well furniſhed of all demaundes that are needefull and neceſſarie for vs. Yee ſhall ſay then,<note place="margin">Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note>

                  <hi>Hallowed bee thy name.</hi> Not that our prayers doe make the name of God holie, but wee pray that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:858:192" rendition="simple:additions"/> his name may be made holie in vs. What is hee, will ſome ſay, that ſhall ſanctifie the name of God? Is it not hee, which ſanctifieth all thinges? Wee are admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in the 20. of <hi>Leuiticus:</hi> Be ye holie, as I am holie. Therefore let vs pray him, that hee will graunt vs grace to enter into the holineſſe, whereof we are aduertiſed in our baptiſme to continue therein. And ſo be we, who aske to bee ſanctified: yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, for ſo much as our ſinnes doe dailie defile vs: in ſuch ſort, as the name of God &amp; his word are not made holie &amp; honored by vs, vnleſſe wee our ſelues be alſo ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.

But it is in the reſpect of vs that wee doe aske, Let thy kingdome come: That wee which haue ſerued in the world and to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, may haue from henceforward Chriſt raigning in vs.</p>
               <p>This kingdome is gotten vnto vs by the bloud of our Sauiour, and ſhall bee truelie fulfilled, when wee ſhall heare this ſweete ſaying: Come yee bleſſed of my father, into the kingdome which is prepared for you &amp;c. Now wee doe well to require the kingdome of heauen. For
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:858:193" rendition="simple:additions"/> there is alſo an earthlie kingdome: But hee that hath taſted the leaſt thing in the world what the heauenlie things are, doth deſpiſe the earthlie. And it is a thing vnto the which wee ought diligentlie to watch with Prayers and ſupplications, leaſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we be ſhut out of Gods kingdome: But that we may be vnder his guide and Empire.</p>
               <p>Manie ſhall come, ſaith hee, from the Eaſt and Weſt, and they ſhall ſit with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> But the children of the kingdome ſhall be caſt out into outward darkneſſe, there where ſhall bee weeping and gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of teeth. The Iewes were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the kingdome ſo long as they were the children of God, and hauing loſt this qualitie, they haue well changed both their condition and their eſtate. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth then:</p>
               <q>Thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen.</q>
               <p>Wee ſay not, let God doe that hee will, but that wee may doe that hee will. For who is hee that wil reſiſt againſt God? What is hee that ſhall let him to doe his will? Now, becauſe that the diuell is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie about vs to turne away our hearts
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:858:193" rendition="simple:additions"/> from obedience to God, and to doe that which God would: wee muſt bee holpen by himſelfe, and none alas is aſſured but by his grace. Our Lord Ieſus being in the agonie of death, and according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, ſtronglie fighting againſt a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of temptations hath left vs yet a faire example: When hee burſteth out in this ſort: If it bee poſſible O father, let this bitter cuppe paſſe away from me: Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe, not my will, but thy will bee done. There is (in the ſecond <hi>Chapter</hi> of the firſt Epiſtle of <hi>S. Iohn</hi>) an other faire ſentence; Loue not the world, for in ſo doing the loue of God is not in you: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the world with all his deſires ſhall paſſe away. And as concerning God hee is euerlaſting: and he that will dwell with him for euermore, muſt doe the will of the euerliuing God. Now,<note place="margin">The will of God.</note> what is the will of God? It is that which Chriſt hath fulfilled, and that hee hath taught vnto vs. And what is that? Humblenes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, ſtayedneſſe in faith, modeſtie in wordes, iuſtneſſe in doings, mercie in workes, diſcipline in manners, and not to doe wrong vnto an other, and to abide it in himſelfe, to keepe in peace with his brethren, to loue God with all his
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:858:194" rendition="simple:additions"/> heart, to loue him as a father, and to feare him as God: and to haue nothing more dearer than Chriſt, for hee alſo hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more dearer than vs, to keepe our ſelues vnſeuered in his charitie, to beare him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie couragiouſlie in his croſſe, when his name or glorie is called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: And in our talkes to ſhew a ſtayed confeſſion, and an aſſuredneſſe in our aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres, when wee bee ſet vppon: and to ſhew patience in death, ſeeing that by it wee are crowned. To doe theſe thinges, is to bee willing to be coheires with the ſonne, and to fulfill the will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <q>In heauen and in earth.</q>
               <p>We may take the ſpirit for the heauen, and the fleſh for the earth, that all our partes may bee obedient vnto God, or rather that we doe the will of God as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <q>Giue vs our dailie bread.</q>
               <p>This may be vnderſtood ſpirituallie of Chriſt, which is the liuing bread: as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in his 6. <hi>Chap.</hi> ſaith. But it is certaine that here the Lord would teach vs, not to
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:858:194" rendition="simple:additions"/> be caryed away with the cares of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life: for as it is ſaid elſewhere, it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth for euerie day to haue his miſeries.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.</note> And in deede, this will not agree well to deſire the kingdome of God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to loue the earthlie life, and to delight therein. Now as <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6.</note> ſith that we brought nothing into this world, neither ſhall wee carie anie thing away: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe wee not content our ſelues with foode and apparell: ſeeing likewiſe that thoſe which doe aſpire vnto riches, fetter themſelues in manie ſorrowes, and eaſilie fall into the ſnares of the diuell? To bee ſhort, the coueting of riches is the roote of all ill.</p>
               <p>This is a goodlie ſhewe that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our maketh in the 12. of <hi>S. Luke,</hi> Oh wretch that thou art, this day ſhall they demaund thy ſoule, and for what purpoſe ſhall the great heapes of thy ritches ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp ſerue thee? And will we be well diſpoſed to follow Chriſt? It behooueth vs at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leaſt to hinder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſes of worldly thinges. In the meane time the iuſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth not forſaken, neither brought into an extremitie by famine. The heauenlie Father which prouideth for the young Rauens and Sparowes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.</note> well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:858:195" rendition="simple:additions"/> to furniſh vs of our lackes that are neceſſarie.</p>
               <p>Wee doe ſee by example apparant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie that which happened vnto <hi>Elie,</hi> in the firſt booke of the kinges and the 17. <hi>Chapter,</hi> where wee reade that namelie a Rauen caried vnto him wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh him. After wee doe pray, that the Lord forgiue vs our offences, as wee doe forgiue them that offend againſt vs. Now hauing receaued aſsiſtance of our foode wee doe demaund the forgiueneſſe of our ſinnes, to the end that hee who is nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of God, may liue to God, and that ſo wee may not onelie haue our bread in this life, but that wee may alſo haue the inioying of the other, that is farre better, and whereunto wee cannot enter, if our ſinnes be not forgiuen vs.</p>
               <p>Now our ſinnes are called debtes: as likewiſe in the 18. of <hi>S. Matthew:</hi> I haue forgiuen thee all thy debt, becauſe thou haſt required it of me. Wee are then my brethren here warned, that wee be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, praying to God for the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes, and asking grace of God, the conſcience being ouercome through offence.</p>
               <pb n="331" facs="tcp:858:195" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Therefore let none of vs ſet vp our ſelues, what giftes ſoeuer wee have, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that dailie we ſinne, and doe aske mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of GOD. If wee doe confeſſe our ſinnes ſaith <hi>S. Iohn</hi> in the firſt <hi>Chap.</hi> of his firſt <hi>Epiſtle:</hi> hee is faithfull and iuſt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs our ſinnes: But if wee ſay that there is no ſinne in vs, wee doe lie. And ſince that this good Ieſus doeth make vs aske forgiueneſſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> our offences, hee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs a certaine aſſurance to finde it, hee I ſay, that maketh vs ſtrong through the mercifulneſſe of his father.</p>
               <p>The condition that hee hath ioyned to this demaund, buindeth vs before GOD to forgiue others, if that wee will that he forgiue vs. This is it that hee ſpeaketh in an other place. With what meaſure you mete vnto others, the ſame ſhall they meaſure vnto you. And in the 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Saint Matthew</hi> the ſeruant that goeth on againſt his companion with all rigor, is reproued, caſt into priſon, and declared vnwoorthie of the fauour of his Maiſter.</p>
               <p>And yet this is more clearelie expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Ieſus Chriſt. When yee ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before God to pray vnto him: If you
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:858:196" rendition="simple:additions"/> haue anie thing againſt anie bodie. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue him: otherwiſe your father will not forgiue you. Then doe wee neuer make this prayer, but that we doe condemne our ſelues, if wee forgiue not one an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For as the Lord calleth vs to peace, in regenerating vs: ſo will hee that wee doe continue in that brotherhoode and friendſhip. And in deede this is the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſacrifice that wee can offer vnto God, that is, our louing heartes knit together. For God loueth the offering of him who hath a louing heart: But if the heart be froward, then doeth nothing of his actions or doinges pleaſe the Lord. A thing that is plainelie ſeene in the hiſtore of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain.</hi> In ſhort, for ſo much as hee which hateth his brother is a murtherer,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.</note> &amp; God will haue no acquaintance with murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: let vs make no account to obtaine his diuine fauour, if wee be not louing and at peace with our neighbors.</p>
               <p>Afterwards the Lord warneth vs howe wee ſhould pray.</p>
               <q>Lead vs not into Temptation.</q>
               <p>ANd in this behalfe hee dooth warne vs, howe the aduerſarie can doe nothing
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:858:196" rendition="simple:additions"/> againſt vs, but in ſo much as the Lorde dooth ſuffer him, to the end that all our feare and reuerence bee alwayes made readie to the Lorde. Wee reade in the 24. <hi>Chapt.</hi> of the ſecond booke of the <hi>Kinges,</hi> how God did deliuer the citie of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> into the handes of the king of <hi>Babylon.</hi> For it was by the occaſion of our ſinnes, that the wicked were let looſe againſt vs: as it is ſaid in the 42. of <hi>Eſai:</hi> Who is it that giueth <hi>Iacob</hi> for a ſpoile? Is it God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whome they haue ſinned? And in the firſt booke of the <hi>Kinges</hi> and 11. <hi>Chap.</hi> The Lord threatened <hi>Salomon</hi> to raiſe vp an aduerſarie againſt him, becauſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he had forgotten himſelfe in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting ſo manie vilanous thinges.<note place="margin">Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> And as concerning theſe powers and temptations which hee prepareth againſt vs, they are for two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers cauſes: Either it is to puniſh vs when wee doe offend: or elſe to make vs victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when as by them wee be onelie proued &amp; tried: which may be ſeene in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hiſtorie of <hi>Iob.</hi> The Lorde in the 19. of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> ſpeaking of himſelfe, ſaid vnto <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late:</hi> Thou ſhouldeſt haue no power ouer me, if it were not giuen thee from aboue.</p>
               <p>Now this prayer whereby wee doe pray, that the Lord lead vs not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,<pb n="334" facs="tcp:858:197" rendition="simple:additions"/> doeth repreſent before our eyes, mans weakeneſſe, that is ſubiect vnto ſo many knockes; in ſuch ſort as it is not for him to doe any brauerie, but rather dailie to watch, to the ende that hee enter not into temptation following ſo many war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges as are made vnto vs. The ſpirite is readie but the fleſh is weake, what then ſhall we doe? Let vs praie the Lorde: and that that we ſhall aske with humbleneſſe, he will grant vs for his fidelitie. There is in the end of the praier,</p>
               <q>But deliuer vs from euill.</q>
               <p>Vnder this is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehended all that our enemies can deuiſe and platte againſt vs, and wherewith we be defended if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord doth heare our praiers, &amp; lend vnto vs his helpe. Well then, when we doe pray to be preſerued from euill, it is to be deliuered from all daunger, and from all enterpriſes whether it be from ſathan, or the world: in ſuch ſort as hauing the protection of God againſt euil, we may wel hold vs moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For how ſhall he feare any ill in this world, that is kept of God in this world, &amp; compaſſed about with his ſafegard? To be
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:858:197" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſhort, this is the life euerlaſting &amp; the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of all good hap,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.</note> to know one onelie true God, and him whom he had ſent into this world, Ieſus Chriſt our Sauiour. Now our Lord Ieſus hath not onelie commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to pray,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke.</hi> 6.</note> but he himſelfe hath giuen vs an example, withdrawing himſelfe ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp, into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mountaine to make his prayer. And if he did pray which was exempt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne: how is it then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we poore wretches doe not pray to God?<note place="margin">The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Ieſus Chriſt.</note> And if he haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome times whole nightes therein, wherefore doe we leaue off a thing ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie? His prayer was not ſo much for himſelfe, as for vs. And wee ſee that which is ſpoken, how y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Sathan had deſire to ſift the Apoſtles: but that he had prayed that their faith ſhould not faile them. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>S. Iohn</hi> he ſaith: I pray not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but for all thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhall beleeue in me. O what bountie &amp; affectioned loue was that of our ſauiour, that was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to redeeme vs by his bloud, but had moreouer great deſire to pray for vs. And he hath prayed that we might bee all one, well knowing that in the kingdome of God no diſcord doeth enter.</p>
               <p>Nowe, when wee pray my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, let all fleſhlie thinges bee farre
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:858:198"/> from vs, that the ſpirit may thinke vppon none other thing but vppon onelie praier. And thereof commeth the manner that wee haue, when as one in the beginning of our prayers pronounceth theſe wordes: <hi>Lift vp your heartes.</hi> And the people aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere: <hi>Wee lift them vp vnto the Lord.</hi> So that it is requiſite that our heartes be ſhut vp from Sathan, and open vnto our God.</p>
               <p>The Diuell is craftie and hee ſeeketh ſome clift, creuie or chinke by the which hee may ſlide into our vnderſtandinges, and to turne them away from God: So that by this meane hee maketh vs to haue one thing in our heartes and an other thing in our tongues: and yet in the meane ſpace it is the heart that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, &amp; not the ſound of the mouth. For what lack of conſideration is this, for a man to be wretched in manie thoughtes in praying to God, ſeeing that it is a thing wherein wee ought ſo much to take heed how wee pray vnto this great God? How wouldeſt thou that GOD ſhould heare thee, when that thou doeſt not heare thy ſelfe? Wouldeſt thou y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God ſhould haue remembrance of thee, &amp; thou doeſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whit at all remember thy ſelfe? This is to giue our ſelues for a pray vnto our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:858:198" rendition="simple:additions"/> and to offend the maieſtie of GOD: This is alſo to watch with the eyes, and to ſleepe with the heart. Furthermore it is needefull that the praier haue his effect, and not be barren: and this is the cauſe wherefore the ſcripture hath often times ioyned with it almes and faſting, as the examples are thereof in <hi>Toby,</hi> and in the good captaine <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whereof it is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the <hi>10.</hi> of the <hi>Actes.</hi> And in the <hi>58.</hi> of <hi>Eſay,</hi> amongeſt other thinges that the Lorde requireth of thoſe which call vpon him, it is that they breake their breade vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe which haue hunger.</p>
               <p>Beholde heere the chiefe pointes that are requiſite in true prayer that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> deſcribeth.</p>
               <p>Bleſſed are thoſe whome the Lorde ſhall finde waking and praying: be it that he take vs by death, or elſe that wee be chaunged in the twincking of an eie to appeare in his iudgement. Now, O Lord giue vs grace to praiſe thee: vnto whom be all honour and glorie for euer. So be it.</p>
